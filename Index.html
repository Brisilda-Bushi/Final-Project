                            <br>I few words about me, I was born on 11<sup>th</sup> of August 1991 in Albania, around the age of 3 years old my parents decided to moved to Greece.
                            <br>
                            Since then I was raised in a beautiful island called Crete and the name of the city is Chania.
                            <br>

                        <figcaption class="citycap">
                            <br>From the photo on your left you can take a glimpse of the most popular and busy area of Chania, since it is located inside an island there are plenty of nice beaches to visit, great food (especially if you love seafood) and amazing views.
                            <br><br>In another city of the island I have completed my studies at a Technical Institute in the field of Civil Engineering <ion-icon name="business"></ion-icon>
                            <br>
                            <br>As soon as I got my degree on February 2016 I moved to Berlin, the main reason of my move was because I wanted to be able to live with my partner.
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <br>Since moving to Berlin I had to find some hobbies. As you can see from the photo on your right, one of my hobbies currently include biking. I used to not be good at biking, the main reason is that I learned quite late and it was when I was on my early teenage years and as soon as the bike broke we had no replacement so I forgot about it. In a city like Berlin it is something that is really enjoyable especially during spring and summer.

                            <br>My favorite Hobby, which I enjoy the most is gaming. I have and am playing video games through PS4, PC, VR and Mobile, I enjoy a lot of different type of games except First Person Shooter games. I guess that is because I am really not good at such games but also because they seem not too interesting to me. I love games that include hack and slash, one of my all times favorite is Witcher 3 (I have played it 2 times so far) also any kind of puzzle games such as Monument Valley or Lara Croft Go.
                            <br> I consider that everyone can enjoy a game even if the game seems to be as simple as Candy Crush.
